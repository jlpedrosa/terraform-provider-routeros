## Example Usage

## Schema

### Required

- `interface` (String) Name of the interface.
- `name` (String) Changing the name of this resource will force it to be recreated.
	> The links of other configuration properties to this resource may be lost!
	> Changing the name of the resource outside of a Terraform will result in a loss of control integrity for that resource!
- `vlan_id` (Number)

### Optional

- `arp` (String) Address Resolution Protocol mode:
				disabled - the interface will not use ARP
				enabled - the interface will use ARP
				local-proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to the same interface
				proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to other interfaces
				reply-only - the interface will only reply to requests originated from matching IP address/MAC address combinations which are entered as static entries in the ARP table. No dynamic entries will be automatically stored in the ARP table. Therefore for communications to be successful, a valid static entry must already exist.
- `arp_timeout` (String) ARP timeout is time how long ARP record is kept in ARP table after no packets are received from IP. Value auto equals to the value of arp-timeout in IP/Settings, default is 30s. Can use postfix ms, s, M, h, d for milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours or days. If no postfix is set then seconds (s) is used.
- `comment` (String)
- `disabled` (Boolean)
- `loop_protect` (String)
- `loop_protect_disable_time` (String)
- `loop_protect_send_interval` (String)
- `mtu` (String) Layer3 Maximum transmission unit ('auto', 0 .. 65535)
- `use_service_tag` (Boolean)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `l2mtu` (Number) Layer2 Maximum transmission unit. [See](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Maximum_Transmission_Unit_on_RouterBoards).
- `loop_protect_status` (String)
- `mac_address` (String) Current mac address.
- `running` (Boolean)

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
# Import with the name of the vlan interface in case of the example use VLAN_TEST
terraform import routeros_interface_vlan.interface_vlan VLAN_TEST
```
